### A clone of the latest released OPTI Toolbox v2.28 (@[jonathancurrie/OPTI](https://github.com/jonathancurrie/OPTI)).

# OPTI Toolbox
If you are interested in optimization, use MATLAB + Windows and like free stuff, OPTI could be for you. See the [OPTI Wiki](https://inverseproblem.co.nz/OPTI/) for details on solving linear, nonlinear, continuous and discrete optimization problems using MATLAB!

#### Installing OPTI
Once you have cloned or downloaded OPTI to your PC, simply open MATLAB and navigate in MATLAB to the directory where you have placed OPTI (hopefully somewhere permanent). Right click on `opti_Install.m` and click Run. Follow the prompts (Yes 'Y' is the normal response to every question) to install OPTI - easy!

#### Using OPTI
The best way to start using OPTI is to have a look at the [Examples](https://inverseproblem.co.nz/OPTI/index.php/Examples/Examples) on the OPTI Wiki. There are lots of problem and code examples (which all work) as well as helpful definitions. The [Basic Usage](https://inverseproblem.co.nz/OPTI/index.php/GetStart/Basics) page is a good place to start for all new users.


#### License
OPTI is released under the 3-clause BSD license. It is free software, and is released as an open-source package.
